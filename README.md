This is a program to run gifs from the Giphy API

By clicking the name of a Simpsons character in the top row 10 still images will be displayed below. If the name is double clicked, 20 images will be displayed.

If you click on one of the still images, they will become animated. If clicked again, it will freeze.

If you would like to see Gifs of a character that is not included, simply type their name in the search bar under "Add a Character" and click submit. 

A button will populate above and if clicked, 10 stills will be displayed below and if double clicked, 20 stills will be displayed. As referenced above, if you click on the stills they will become animated.

Additionally, below each Gif is it's title, rating and the opportunity to downlaod the Gif (the download is not functioning approporiately). 

To add a gif to favorites, double cick on it. 

To display the favorites, click on the favorites button, to remove a gif from this lists click on the image.

This project provides a great introduction to apis and ties it in with jquery, html and css. 

This project is currently maintained and updated by Andrew Andersen (andersac88@gmail.com) if you have any questions, feel free to contact me directly.

I have found it difficult to make the download button actually download or to find a more effective way to increase the number of gifs.
