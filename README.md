# GifTastic

This is a program to run gifs from the Giphy API

By clicking the name of a Simpsons character in the top row 10 still images will be displayed below. 

If you click on one of the stills, they will become animated. If clicked again, they will freeze.

If you would like to see Gifs of a character that is not included, simply type their name in the search bar under "Add a Character" and click submit. 

I button will populate above and if clicked, 10 stills will be displayed below. As referenced above, if you click on the stills they will become animated.

Additionally, below each Gif is it's rating and the opportunity to downlaod the Gif.

This project provides a great introduction to apis and ties it in with jquery,, html and css.
